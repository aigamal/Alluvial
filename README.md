## Personal Code Repository for Alluvial Review

Welcome to my personal code repository! This repository contains a collection of code snippets and small projects that I've worked on as part of my personal coding journey. These projects are prepared as samples for review by Alluvial, showcasing my coding skills and the range of projects I've explored.

## Projects
Here's a brief overview of some of the projects included in this repository:

### CalSync
A script to sync and update my calendars from different sources to a single personal view.

### Ransomware
A sample ransomware implementation (for educational purposes only).

### Simple JWT Verification Proxy
A reverse proxy that acts as a gateway for services and verifies JWT tokens before forwarding requests. This adds an additional layer of security and can centralize token validation logic.

Feel free to explore each project's directory to find more information about the code, its purpose, and any specific instructions for running or testing it.

Remember that these projects are meant to be illustrative of my coding style and abilities. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

## Contact
If you have any inquiries or would like to discuss any of the projects or code in this repository, I'd be happy to connect with you. Thank you for taking the time to explore my personal code repository. I hope you find the projects interesting and insightful!
